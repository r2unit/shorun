# Shorun

> [!WARNING]
> Shorun is still under development so it is also still in the pre-alpha phase! So do not use it for production purposes.

Shorun is a high-speed, modern tool for backing up network device configurations. The project was started because existing solutions like RANCID and Oxidized were not fast or sufficient for our operational needs. We built Shorun from the ground up to be a capable and efficient replacement.

The name itself is a nod to the ubiquitous Cisco IOS command, show running-config, which is used to display a device's current configuration.
